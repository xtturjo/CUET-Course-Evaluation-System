This project aims to create an efficient web application for reviewing and rating university
classes. The system will offer a user-friendly interface for students to explore, submit
reviews, and provide ratings for their courses. Additionally, an administrative module
will empower faculty and staff to manage class information and assess student feedback
effectively.
